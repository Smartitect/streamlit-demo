## Exploratory Data Analysis

We now explore factors that appear to have contributed towards survival rates on the Titanic ðŸš¢.

KeyðŸ”‘:
- **N**=number of passengers
- **S**=survival rate

# ### Women and children first?
# 
# This analysis certainly shows a general trend that females were given priority.  It's not so convicing for children!


st.plotly_chart(ChartingHelper.create_strip_boxplot(titanic_passengers_cleaned, 'Sex', 'Age'))


# ### Did wealth have an influence?
# 
# Survival rate overall is signfiicantly higher for first class versus third class.


st.plotly_chart(ChartingHelper.create_strip_boxplot(titanic_passengers_cleaned, 'Pclass', 'FareLog10'))


# ### Was occupation a factor?
# 
# Interesting that all 8 of the reverands on board perished.
