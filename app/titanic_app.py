## Exploratory Data Analysis
 
Uses convention:
- ðŸŸ¢: survived
- ðŸ”´: died
- **N**: number of passengers
- **S**: survival rate
 
What factors contributed towards a passenger's survival rate?


### Women and children first?

This analysis certainly shows a general trend that females were given priority.  It's not so convicing for children!

# Interesting that all 8 of the reverands on board perished.
